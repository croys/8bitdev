;   "bigint": variable precision integers

;   Parameters specified in the documentation for each function are
;   annotated as follows.
;     (p) - preserved: value at exit is the same at entry
;     (w) - written: value at exit is an intended output value
;     (d) - destroyed: value at exit may be different from value at entry
;           and is not useful
;   Flags should be considered destroyed unless otherwise specified.
;   * For pointers (usually in the zero page), two letters are given: the
;   first for the pointer itself and the second for the contents of the
;   buffer to which it points.
;   * Pointers are also given a suffix of subscript 0 or 1 to indicate if
;   their indexing is 0-based (`ptr₀` points to the beginning of the
;   buffer) or 1-based (`ptr₁` points to the byte before the beginning of
;   the buffer). The latter is often used because it's easier and more
;   efficient to loop through such a buffer on the 6502.

;---------------------------------------------------------------------

;   Bigints are stored in big-endian format on 6502: a length byte
;   followed by the integer in two's complement format.
;
;   We use big-endian format, despite being the opposite of native
;   6502 order, because we generally want to loop from the LSB to the
;   MSB and looping towards zero saves means we can start with the
;   length and decrement and compare with zero, saving the CMP we'd
;   need to do if counting up to the length.
